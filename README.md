# Welcome to the Repo for 42 Months After's Pacific Northwest PvP Server!
In an effort to help support the DayZ community, we publish all our files for other server owners to use and reference. The only thing we ask is that you credit our work if you add any of it to your server. We will be making updates regularly so follow for changes and improvements.

## About 42 Months After
We are a custom DayZ community that hosts 5 different servers, 3 for PC, 1 for Xbox and 1 for PlayStation. All are modded and have a truly original flavors of DayZ. You can check out our website at [42MonthsAfter.com](http://www.42MonthsAfter.com) or join our [Discord server](http://discord.42MonthsAfter.com) to help start shaping our worlds.

## How to Use this Repo
You can check out the mpmissions and profile files for the tweaks and changes that we have made customizing our flavor of DayZ. We have removed anything that might be used against us like credentials and API tokens, but everything else is available for your use. Since the map isn't releasing the files for server owners before launch, we are doing our best to get a head start as best we can given the info shared in their [Discord](https://discord.gg/jARcNVEgrN)
